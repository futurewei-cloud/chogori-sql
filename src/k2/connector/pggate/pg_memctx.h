// the K2SQL memory context.

// - Each K2SQL Memctx will be associated with a Postgres MemoryContext.
// - K2SQL Memctx will be initialized to NULL and later created on its first use.
// - When Postgres MemoryContext is destroyed, K2SQL Memctx will be destroyed.

//   associated K2SQL Memctx. The object is automatically destroyed when K2SQL Memctx is destroyed.

  // API: Create(), Destroy(), and Reset()
  // - Because Postgres process own K2SQL memory context, only Postgres processes should call
  //   these functions to manage K2SQL memory context.
  // - When Postgres process (a C Program) is exiting, it assumes that all associated memories
  //   are destroyed and will not call Destroy() to free K2SQL memory context. As a result,
  //   PgGate must release the remain K2SQL memory contexts itself. Create(), Destroy(), and
  //   Reset() API uses a global variable for that purpose.  When Postgres processes exit, the
  //   global destructor will free all K2SQL memory contexts.

  // - In Postgres, the objects in the outer context can references to the objects of the nested
  //   context but not vice versa, so it is safe to clear objects of outer context.
  // - In K2SQL, the above abstraction must be followed, but I am not yet sure that we did.
  //   For now we destroy the K2SQL objects in the current context also as we should. However,
  //   if the objects in nested context might still have referenced to the objects of the outer
  //   memctx, we can delay the PgStatement objects' destruction.
