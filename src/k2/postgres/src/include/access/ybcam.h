/*
 * SCAN PLAN - Two structures.
 * - "struct YbScanPlanData" contains variables that are used during preparing statement.
 * - "struct YbScanDescData" contains variables that are used thru out the life of the statement.
 *
 * YugaByte ScanPlan has two different lists.
 *   Binding list:
 *   - This list is used to receive the user-given data for key columns (WHERE clause).
 *   - "sk_attno" is the INDEX's attnum for the key columns that are used to query data.
 *     In YugaByte, primary index attnum is the same as column attnum in the UserTable.
 *   - "bind_desc" is the description of the index columns (count, types, ...).
 *   - The bind lists don't need to be included in the description as they are only needed
 *     during setup.
 *   Target list:
 *   - This list identifies the user-wanted data to be fetched from the database.
 *   - "target_desc" contains the description of the target columns (count, types, ...).
 *   - The target fields are used for double-checking key values after selecting data
 *     from database. It should be removed once we no longer need to double-check the key values.
