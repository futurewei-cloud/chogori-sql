 * Version of the catalog entries in the relcache and catcache.
 * We (only) rely on a following invariant: If the catalog cache version here is
 * actually the latest (master) version, then the catalog data is indeed up to
 * date. In any other case, we will end up doing a cache refresh anyway.
 * (I.e. cache data is only valid if the version below matches with master's
 * version, otherwise all bets are off and we need to refresh.)
 *
 * So we should handle cases like:
 * 1. yb_catalog_cache_version being behind the actual data in the caches.
 * 2. Data in the caches spanning multiple version (because catalog was updated
 *    during a cache refresh).
 * As long as the invariant above is not violated we should (at most) end up
 * doing a redundant cache refresh.
 *
 * TODO: Improve cache versioning and refresh logic to be more fine-grained to
 * reduce frequency and/or duration of cache refreshes.
